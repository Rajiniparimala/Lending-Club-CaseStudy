## General Information

Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 

The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. 

The case study focuses on EDA mainly, to understand the parameters that help us detect the loan defaulters 

The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
